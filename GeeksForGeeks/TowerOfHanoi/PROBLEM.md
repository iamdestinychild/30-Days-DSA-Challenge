## Question : Give the algorithm to solve Tower of Hanoi Problem. 

The tower of Hanoi is a famous puzzle where we have three rods and N disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod. You are given the number of discs N. Initially, these discs are in the rod 1. You need to print all the steps of discs movement so that all the discs reach the 3rd rod. Also, you need to find the total moves.
Note: The discs are arranged such that the top disc is numbered 1 and the bottom-most disc is numbered N. Also, all the discs have different sizes and a bigger disc cannot be put on the top of a smaller disc

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
Output:
move disk 1 from rod 1 to rod 2
move disk 2 from rod 1 to rod 3
move disk 1 from rod 2 to rod 3
3
Explanation: For N=2 , steps will be
as follows in the example and total
3 steps will be taken.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
Output:
move disk 1 from rod 1 to rod 3
move disk 2 from rod 1 to rod 2
move disk 1 from rod 3 to rod 2
move disk 3 from rod 1 to rod 3
move disk 1 from rod 2 to rod 1
move disk 2 from rod 2 to rod 3
move disk 1 from rod 1 to rod 3
7
Explanation: For N=3 , steps will be
as follows in the example and total
7 steps will be taken.
 
## Solution :

The TowerOfHanoi function is a recursive function that relies on four parameters:
n: The number of total disks we have to move
source: The first peg
aux: The auxiliary peg
dest: The destination peg
The code first moves the base disk to another peg(when n=1) and then using recursive function moves n-1 disk form source to auxiliary peg. And then moves the largest peg to destination peg
