PROBLEM:
Given an integer array nums of length n, you want to create an array ans of length 2n where ans[i] == nums[i] and ans[i + n] == nums[i] for 0 <= i < n (0-indexed).

HOW I SOLVED IT:
Function Definition:
def create_ans(nums): defines a function named create_ans that takes a list nums as input.

Finding the Length:
n = len(nums) calculates the length of the input list nums and assigns it to the variable n.

Initializing ans List:
ans = [0] * (2 * n) creates a list called ans with a length of 2n (twice the length of nums). All elements in this list are initially set to 0.

Loop to Assign Values:
for i in range(n): initiates a loop that will iterate n times, where n is the length of nums.

Assignment of Values:
ans[i] = ans[i + n] = nums[i] is a compound assignment statement that does the following:
ans[i] = nums[i]: Assigns the value of nums[i] to the i-th element of ans.
ans[i + n] = nums[i]: Assigns the same value to the element at index i + n in ans.
This line essentially copies the value from nums[i] to both ans[i] and ans[i + n].

Returning the Result:
return ans returns the modified ans list.

Example Usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]: An example list is provided.

Calling the Function:
ans = create_ans(nums) calls the create_ans function with nums as an argument. The returned list is assigned to the variable ans.

Printing the Result:
print(ans) prints the final result.
