# 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

**Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.**

### Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
```

###Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is n.
- 1 <= k <= n <= 5000
- 0 <= Node.val <= 1000
