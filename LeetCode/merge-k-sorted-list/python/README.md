To run the Python code with the filename `merge-k.py` on your local machine, follow these steps:

**Prepare the Python Environment:**

Make sure you have Python installed on your local machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

**Create the Python File:**

Create a new file named `merge-k.py` using a text editor or code editor of your choice.

**Copy and Paste the Code:**

Copy the provided Python code and paste it into the `merge-k.py` file.

**Save the File:**

Save the `merge-k.py` file after pasting the code.

**Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**

Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

**Navigate to the Directory:**

Use the cd command (change directory) to navigate to the directory where the merge-k.py file is located. For example:

`bash`
`Copy code`
`cd /path/to/directory`
`Run the Python Script:`

In the terminal, run the Python script using the python command followed by the filename:
Copy code
python merge-k.py

**View the Output:**

The code will execute, and if there is any output (in this case, it will print the merged linked list), you will see it displayed in the terminal.

That's it! You have successfully run the Python script named merge-k.py on your local machine.

## Intuition

The code implements a solution to merge k sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list. This problem is often encountered in scenarios where you have multiple sources of sorted data that need to be combined into a single sorted result.

## Approach

The code uses a `divide-and-conquer strategy` to merge the k lists efficiently. The mergeTwoLists function merges two sorted linked lists into one, and the merge function recursively divides the list of lists into smaller subproblems until it merges all the lists. The final merged list is returned as the result.

**mergeTwoLists function:**

Merges two sorted linked lists by comparing the values of their nodes.
It uses a dummy node to simplify the merging process and returns the merged list.

**Merge function:**

Recursively divides the list of lists into smaller subproblems.
Merges the left and right halves of the list of lists by calling mergeTwoLists.
Continues dividing and merging until all lists are combined into one.

**mergeKLists function:**

Initializes the merge process by calling merge with the entire list of lists.
Returns the merged list as the final result.

## Complexity Analysis

# Time Complexity:

The mergeTwoLists function takes O(m + n) time to merge two lists of lengths m and n.
The merge function divides the problem into halves, so it takes O(N _ log(k)) time, where N is the total number of nodes in all lists.
Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(N _ log(k))`, where k is the number of input lists.

# Space Complexity:

The space complexity is dominated by the recursion stack during the merge function, which can go up to `O(log(k))` due to the divide-and-conquer approach.
Additionally, a few extra variables are used in each recursion, so the space complexity is O(log(k)) due to the function call stack.
