Given the head of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Example 2:


Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]
Example 3:

Input: head = []
Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
