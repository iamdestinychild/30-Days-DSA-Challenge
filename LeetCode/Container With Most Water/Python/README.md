Container With Most Water in python

Input:
You are given an integer array height of length n

Output:
maximum capacity a container formed by any two vertical lines in the array.

Example:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

So, we need to find maximum area formed using two lines, where area = width * height
heights are given, hence, Need to find the widths.

So, to find width of a container, all we have to do is get the difference of line.

6				|	    |	                            |	            |

       0        1       2       3       4       5       6       7       8
	            ^                                       ^
So, my one pointer is on index 1 & another pointer is on index 6

Therefore, width = right - left i.e. 6 - 1 => 5

And if we look at height,
height = min(8, 8)
Thus, area will be:-
area = 5 * 8 => 40

Now you'll ask why we are choosing the min height because, the water we fill in our container will got overflow, so to avoid that we are gabbing the min line.

So, now you ask. How do we solve this problem efficiently. We gonna solve this in linear time.

So, for that we have

> max area which is intially 0
> Then, we going to have 2 pointers. One in left start at 0th index & one right start from last index.
Now, if I calculate the width & height our area will be:

7				|	                                    |	            |                             width = 8 - 0 = 8
6				|	    |	                            |	            |                             height = min(1, 7)
5				|	    |	            |	            |	            |                             Area = 8 * 1 = 8
4				|	    |	            |	    |	    |	            |
3				|	    |	            |	    |	    |	    |	    |                             max = 0 -> max = 8
2				|	    |	    |	    |	    |	    |	    |	    |
1	   |	    |	    |	    |	    |	    |	    |	    |	    |
       0        1       2       3       4       5       6       7       8
	   ^                                                                ^
	  left                                                            right
By this pretty much we have get one formula all it is area = width * height
i.e. area = (right - left) * min(height[left], height[right])

So, now you ask which pointer we suppose to move. It's preety simple. We gonna move the smaller height pointer. Why?
Because, we are trying to find very max. container

If we have smaller height on left or right we don't care about it. We always want a higher height line on our left & right.

Okay, so now moving forward. left pointer has smaller height, so it will move forward
