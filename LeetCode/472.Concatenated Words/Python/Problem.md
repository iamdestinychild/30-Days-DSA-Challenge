Given an array of strings words (without duplicates), return all the concatenated words in the given list of words.

A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words (not necesssarily distinct) in the given array.

 
Example 1:

Input: words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
"dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
Example 2:

Input: words = ["cat","dog","catdog"]
Output: ["catdog"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 104
1 <= words[i].length <= 30
words[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
All the strings of words are unique.
1 <= sum(words[i].length) <= 105


Approach:

The given code defines a Python class called `Solution` with a method `findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict` that takes a list of words as input and returns a list of words that can be formed by concatenating other words from the input list.

1. Define a helper function called `canConcatenate(word)` that checks whether a given word can be formed by concatenating other words from the input list. This function uses dynamic programming (DP) to determine this.

2. Create an empty set called `word_set` to store the input words for efficient lookups.

3. Initialize an empty list called `concatenated_words` to store the words that can be formed by concatenating other words.

4. For each word in the input list:
   - Remove the current word from the `word_set` temporarily to prevent self-concatenation.
   - Call the `canConcatenate` function to check if the current word can be formed by concatenating other words from the `word_set`.
   - If `canConcatenate` returns True, add the current word to the `concatenated_words` list.
   - Add the current word back to the `word_set` for the next iteration.

5. Finally, return the `concatenated_words` list, which contains all the words that can be formed by concatenating other words from the input list.

The `canConcatenate` function uses dynamic programming to check if a word can be formed by breaking it into smaller substrings and checking if those substrings are present in the `word_set`. It maintains a boolean DP array `dp`, where `dp[i]` represents whether the first `i` characters of the word can be formed by concatenating words from the `word_set`. The function iterates through the word's characters, checking if any substring from `j` to `i` is in the `word_set` and if `dp[j]` is True. If so, it sets `dp[i]` to True, indicating that the word can be concatenated. The final value of `dp[-1]` determines if the entire word can be concatenated.
