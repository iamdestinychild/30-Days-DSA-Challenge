# Spiral Matrix
The Spiral Matrix problem takes a 2-Dimensional array of N-rows and M-columns as an input, and prints the elements of this matrix in spiral order. The spiral begins at the top left corner of the input matrix, and prints the elements it encounters, while looping towards the center of this matrix, in a clockwise manner.
