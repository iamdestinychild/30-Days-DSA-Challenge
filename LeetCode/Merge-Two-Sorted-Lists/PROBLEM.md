# [1929. Concatenation of Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenation-of-array/)

Given two sorted linked list, the list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

```example
Example 1:

Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4]

Example 2:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Constraints:

n1 == list1.length
n2 == list2.length
0 <= n1 <= n2 <= 50
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

```
