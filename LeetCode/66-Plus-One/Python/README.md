## Algorithm

The algorithm to solve this problem is as follows:

1. Start from the least significant digit (i.e., the last element of the array).
2. Add one to the current digit.
3. If the sum is greater than or equal to 10, then carry over 1 to the next digit.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach the most significant digit.
5. If the most significant digit is greater than or equal to 10, then prepend a 1 to the array.

## Python Implementation

Here is a Python implementation of the algorithm:

```python
def increment_large_integer(digits):
  """Increments a large integer represented as an integer array.

  Args:
    digits: A list of integers representing the large integer.

  Returns:
    A list of integers representing the incremented large integer.
  """

  carry = 1
  for i in range(len(digits) - 1, -1, -1):
    digits[i] += carry
    if digits[i] >= 10:
      digits[i] -= 10
      carry = 1
    else:
      carry = 0

  if carry == 1:
    digits.insert(0, 1)

  return digits


## Usage

To use the `increment_large_integer()` function, simply pass in a list of integers representing the large integer that you want to increment. The function will return a list of integers representing the incremented large integer.

For example, to increment the large integer `123`, you would do the following:

python
>>> digits = [1, 2, 3]
>>> increment_large_integer(digits)
[1, 2, 4]


## Conclusion

This problem is a good example of how to use arrays to represent large numbers. It is also a good example of how to carry over digits when performing arithmetic on large numbers.
