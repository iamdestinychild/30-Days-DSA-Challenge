** Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.**

## Example:
```
Example 1:

Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.


Example 2:

Input: heights = [2,4]
Output: 4
```

## Constraints:
- 1 <= heights.length <= 105
- 0 <= heights[i] <= 104
