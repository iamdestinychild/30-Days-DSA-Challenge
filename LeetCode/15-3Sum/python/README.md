To run the Python code provided on your local machine step by step, you can follow these instructions:

1. **Install Python**:
   If you haven't already, make sure you have Python installed on your local machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. **Create a Python File**:
   Create a new text file and save it with a `.py` extension. For example, you can name it `threesum.py`.

3. **Edit the Python File**:
   Open the `threesum.py` file in a text editor of your choice, such as Notepad (on Windows) or any code editor like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text.

4. **Copy and Paste Code**:
   Copy the Python code provided in my previous response (with type annotations) and paste it into your `threesum.py` file.

5. **Save the File**:
   After pasting the code, save the `threesum.py` file.

6. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**:
   Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

7. **Navigate to the File's Directory**:
   Use the `cd` (change directory) command to navigate to the directory where your `threesum.py` file is located. For example, if your file is on the desktop, you can navigate there like this:

   ```
   cd Desktop
   ```

8. **Run the Python Script**:
   Once you are in the correct directory, you can execute the Python script using the `python` command followed by the script's filename:

   ```
   python threesum.py
   ```

   This will run the code, and if you enter a list of space-separated integers as input, it will print the unique triplets that sum to zero.

9. **Provide Input**:
   When the program runs, it may prompt you to enter input (space-separated integers). Input your list of numbers and press Enter.

10. **View the Output**:
    The program will process your input, find unique triplets, and print them to the console.

That's it! You've successfully run the Python code on your local machine step by step.
