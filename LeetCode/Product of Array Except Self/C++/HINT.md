## HINT
For any nums[i], calculate its left product and calculate its right product, without including nums[i].
Then multiply these left and right product, This will give product of array excluding nums[i].

## HINT FOR FOLLOW UP
The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis. (This statement itself is a hint.)

## TIME COMPLEXITY
O(n)

## SPACE COMPLEXITY
O(1) (if we do not consider output array as extra space for space complexity analysis)
